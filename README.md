Containerized ConnectIQ Development Environment for Linux
==

This is a repository were we build and maintain a development environment where
you can use Garmin SDK's on Linux. Because the Linux SDK (manager) uses
completely outdated software[^1][^2] this Docker development environment uses
Ubuntu Bionic to satisfy its dependencies.

## EULA of Garmin

This project DOES NOT distribute the SDK or the SDK manager, you therefore are
not in violation of the Garmin EULA.

## .Garmin/ConnectIQ

Please make sure you create the following directory in your $HOME.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/.Garmin/ConnectIQ
```

## Building

You can run `./build` to trigger a docker build.

## docker-compose

This project can also build the image via docker-compose, simply run
`docker-compose build`. It will also check if all the files have a correct
license.

In `docker-compose.example-project` you'll find an example docker-compose.yml
file which you can use in your ConnectIQ project.

## SDK manager

You can start the SDK manager by typing `sdkmanager`.

# Thank you

I want to thank [CÃ©dric Dufour](https://github.com/cedric-dufour) for his
[Connect IQ docker work](https://github.com/cedric-dufour/connectiq-sdk-docker) which this
repository has used as a base.

# LICENSE

This project uses Unlicense to respect the fork's license which was[^3]:

> All the stuff contained is this repository is entirely free and may be used,
> copied, modified, distributed and what-so-ever without any constraint.

The only difference is that this project feels that it cannot properly use the
Unlicense license for the Dockerfile itself. As Unlicense states that you can
redistribute the software as a compiled binary itself as well.

> Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute
> this software, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any
> purpose,commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The project has the opinion that redistributing the Dockerfile in a binary form
is the actual Docker image and that includes software from Garmin. As there
isn't a FOSS license that excludes the binary form:

You cannot redistribute the resulting Docker image due to Garmin's EULA and its
closed source character.
